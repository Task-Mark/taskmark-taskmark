# T-013: Wire epic selection to story list

## Description

Connect epic selection in the dashboard to the story parser (T-011) and story list UI (T-012). When the user selects an epic, load and display that epic’s stories for the active project. Clear or reset story selection when the epic or project changes.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Selecting an epic loads stories for that epic from the active project board.
- [x] Changing epic refreshes the story list.
- [x] Changing active project clears epic/story selection or reloads safely.
- [x] Loading and failure states are visible to the user.

## Notes

Pair with T-016 for the next level of drill-down (story → tasks).
