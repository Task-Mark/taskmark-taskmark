# S-005: Story list for selected epic

## User story

As a user, I want to select an epic and see all user stories under it so I can understand how that initiative is broken down.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] User can select an epic from the current project’s epic list (or equivalent picker).
- [x] Selecting an epic shows all stories under that epic’s `stories/` folder.
- [x] Each story row shows at least id, title, status, size, and points (and estimate/actual when available).
- [x] Empty epics (no stories) show an empty state, not a crash.
- [x] Parse errors for individual stories are surfaced without breaking the whole list.
- [x] Story list updates when the selected epic changes.

## Tasks

- [T-011: Parse story markdown under selected epic](items/T-011-parse-story-markdown.md)
- [T-012: Build story list UI](items/T-012-story-list-ui.md)
- [T-013: Wire epic selection to story list](items/T-013-wire-epic-to-story-list.md)
