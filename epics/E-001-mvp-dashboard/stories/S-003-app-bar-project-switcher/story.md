# S-003: App bar project switcher

## User story

As a user, after I set up a master folder, I want an app bar that lets me switch among the discovered (pre-configured) Taskmark projects so I can focus on one project’s epics without re-running setup.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Post-setup screens show an app bar with the Taskmark brand.
- [x] App bar lists discovered projects from the current master folder.
- [x] User can switch the active project from the app bar without clearing the master folder.
- [x] Active project is persisted (cookie) and restored on return visits.
- [x] Epic list shows the active project (not all projects at once).
- [x] User can still change the master folder from the app bar (setup).

## Tasks

- [T-009: Build post-setup app bar UI](items/T-009-app-bar-ui.md)
- [T-010: Persist active project and filter epic list](items/T-010-active-project-cookie.md)
