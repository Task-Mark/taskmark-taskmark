# T-010: Persist active project and filter epic list

## Description

Store the active discovered project in a cookie (separate from the master folder cookie). Switching in the app bar updates the cookie. The board epic list shows only the active project. If the cookie is missing or stale, default to the first discovered project. Clearing/changing the master folder clears or resets the active project.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Active project id/path is stored in a cookie.
- [x] Switching projects updates the cookie and refreshes the epic list.
- [x] Epic list is scoped to the active project.
- [x] Invalid/missing active project falls back to the first discovered project.
- [x] Changing master folder resets active project appropriately.

## Notes

Cookie name: `taskmark_active_project` (project id / folder name under discovery).
