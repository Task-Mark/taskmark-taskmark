# T-002: Implement project folder selection

## Description

Let the user provide a local **master folder** path (path input and/or native folder picker via the mechanism available to this Next.js app — e.g. server-side path, File System Access API, or similar). Capture an absolute path the rest of the app can use to **discover** Taskmark projects in subfolders—not assume a single `taskmark/` at the selected root.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] User can enter or pick a local master folder.
- [x] Selected path is available to subsequent discovery, validation, and load steps.
- [x] Invalid empty selection is blocked with inline feedback.
- [x] Approach for local folder access is documented in Notes if it requires env/dev constraints.

## Notes

Browser sandboxes cannot expose absolute disk paths. Folder selection uses a **native OS folder picker** via the Next.js server (`osascript` on macOS, `zenity` on Linux, PowerShell folder browser on Windows), plus a path text field for paste/edit. Local `next dev` / `next start` only — not suitable for a remote hosted deploy without a different picker strategy. The selected folder is a workspace root that may contain multiple project subfolders.
