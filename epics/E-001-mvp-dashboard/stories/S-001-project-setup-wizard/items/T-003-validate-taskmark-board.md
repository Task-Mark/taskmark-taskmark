# T-003: Validate taskmark board in selected folder

## Description

After the user selects a **master folder**, verify it is usable: the path exists and is readable, and discovery finds **at least one** Taskmark project in its subfolders (via T-008). Do **not** require `taskmark/` at the master root. Surface clear errors for unreadable path vs no projects found.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Master folder that yields ≥1 discovered Taskmark project passes validation.
- [x] Missing/unreadable path shows a specific error message.
- [x] Readable master with zero discovered boards shows a clear “no Taskmark projects found” error.
- [x] Validation is callable from the wizard before persist/continue.
- [x] Does not mutate board files.

## Notes

Keep checks lightweight for MVP; deep schema validation can come later. Relies on discovery (T-008).
