# T-004: Persist selected project and enter app

## Description

On successful validation, store the selected **master folder** path in a **cookie** and navigate the user into the main app surface (epic lists for discovered projects). On subsequent launches, if the cookie holds a master folder path, skip the setup wizard and go straight to the app. Users who already set up must not be forced through setup again. Provide a clear path back into the setup wizard to **switch** master folders and overwrite the cookie.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Valid master folder path is stored in a cookie (not localStorage) and survives reload / browser restart for the cookie’s lifetime.
- [x] Returning users with a master-folder cookie skip the setup wizard and enter the app directly.
- [x] After first successful setup, the user is not required to set up again unless they choose to switch or the cookie is missing/invalid.
- [x] After save, user lands on the epic list surface for projects discovered under that master folder.
- [x] Saved invalid/missing path (or master with no discoverable projects) clears or ignores the cookie and falls back to the wizard with an explanation.
- [x] User can open setup again to switch master folders; confirming a new valid folder updates the cookie.

## Notes

Cookie name `taskmark_master_folder`, httpOnly, maxAge 1 year, stores master folder path.
