# S-001: Project setup wizard

## User story

As a user, I want a setup wizard that lets me select a local **master folder** so the dashboard can discover one or more Taskmark projects in its subfolders.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] First-run (or no master-folder cookie) shows a setup wizard, not an empty dashboard.
- [x] User can choose a local **master folder** path (workspace that may contain multiple projects).
- [x] App discovers Taskmark boards by scanning **subfolders** (does not require `taskmark/` only at the master root).
- [x] App validates that at least one Taskmark project is found (or shows a clear error if none).
- [x] Valid master folder is persisted in a **cookie** and the user continues into the app (epic lists).
- [x] Returning users with a master-folder cookie skip setup entirely — they are not required to set up again.
- [x] User can reopen setup to **switch** master folders; the new selection replaces the cookie.

## Tasks

- [T-001: Build setup wizard UI shell](items/T-001-setup-wizard-ui.md)
- [T-002: Implement project folder selection](items/T-002-folder-selection.md)
- [T-003: Validate taskmark board in selected folder](items/T-003-validate-taskmark-board.md)
- [T-004: Persist selected project and enter app](items/T-004-persist-project-selection.md)
- [T-008: Discover Taskmark projects under master folder](items/T-008-discover-projects-under-master.md)
- [B-003: Setup fails to discover flat multi-repo board](items/B-003-discover-flat-taskmark-board.md)
